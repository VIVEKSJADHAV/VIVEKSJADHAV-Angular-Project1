This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.6.

1. Create a hotel booking form with HTML/CSS/SASS as shown below (you may add some 
additional fields). Screen shown below is indicative you may use any other layout. 
2. The page should be responsive to fit laptop/tab/mobile devices screens (you may use 
bootstrap container class). 
3. Use SASS  CSS preprocessor. 
4. There should be front end validaions for the fields (all fileds are mandatory)- use java script 
functions to do the validation. 
5. When the Book  Now button is clicked there should be validation message (inline in the 
screen) or pop up (to be avoided as much as possible) to indicate the user which fields are 
left blank. 
6. Upons succesful validations another HTML page will be displayed showing “Thanks for 
submitting the booking details. We will get back to you soon”.
